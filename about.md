<p style="padding-top:30px;">
I am a software engineer at Twitter, based in San Francisco Bay Area. I like to use programming to solve what I believe are important and meaningful problems. I have a B.A. in <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/index.php">Computer and Information Sciences</a> and <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/urban/">Urban Studies</a> from University of Pennsylvania. 

In 2015 I co-founded and worked full-time on an e-commerce delivery startup, Epicerie, which was acquired by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/0000065D:US">Inmost Partners</a>. Feel free to reach me at <a href="linkedin.com/soyoungpark05">LinkedIn</a> if you want to chat.
