<p style="width:50%; text-align:left; display:inline-block;">I was wondering what I should put on my personal website, and was listening to this new single album release by IU, titled twenty-three, and decided to have an attempt at translating the lyric to English. </p>

		I’m twenty-three,<br>
and I’m a riddle.<br>
(Question)<br>
What am I? <br>
<br><br>
Take a guess.<br>
<br><br>
I’m twenty-three,<br>
and don’t be wrong — because<br>
I am really very picky. <br>
<br><br>
A bunch of twenty-threes, <br>
looking all a-grown-up,<br>
Please bear with me if I pretend I really am. <br>
<br><br>
This twenty-three, such cheeky age.<br>
Still long way to go, kid. <br>
So bear with me if I pretend<br>
I still need some growing up.<br>
<br><br>
I, yes, surely I like the way it is.<br>
No, no I just want to quit it all.<br>
Ah yes, I actually want to fall in love. <br>
No, I’d rather make loads of money.<br>
<br><br>
Take a guess.<br>
<br><br>
Which one?<br>
Can’t tell from the face,<br>
It’s so easy putting on a mask<br>
when you’re thinking something else.<br>
<br><br>
Which one?<br>
I can’t know either,<br>
For I never wrote a single line of lie <br>
to begin with.<br>
<br><br>
Like a fox-like bear-like fox or<br>
something else.<br>
<br><br>
Which one?<br>
Pick one; I am so used to<br>
many-colored prejudices.<br>
Check it out<br>
<br><br>
I’m not afraid.<br>
Even when I make a mess,<br>
people are oh-so-kind everyday.<br>
<br><br>
That lady greeting me, <br>
I worry if she’d still be smiling <br>
after the corner’s end? <br>
<br><br>
I want to stay a child forever<br>
No I will be a lady, all dewy.<br>
But no, I will stay as silent as a grave.<br>
Actually — scrap all that. <br>
<br><br>
Take a guess.<br>
<br><br>
Which one?<br>
Can’t ever tell from the face.<br>
It’s so easy putting on a mask<br>
when you’re thinking something else.<br>
<br><br>
Which one?<br>
I can’t tell either.<br>
For I never wrote a single line of lie to begin with.<br>
<br><br>
Like a fox-like bear-like fox, or<br>
something else.<br>
<br><br>
Which one?<br>
Pick one; I am so used to<br>
many-colored prejudices.<br>
<br>
I want to be liked by you.<br>
Can I be just a little naughty?<br>
I want to be liked by you.<br>
Can I play puppets with you?<br>
<br><br>
Take a guess.<br>
