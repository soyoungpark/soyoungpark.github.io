<p style="padding-top:30px;">
I am a software engineer at Pinterest, based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I enjoy working as a team to solve interesting challenges, ranging from Twitter's trust and safety system to Pinterest's search experience. I have a B.A. in <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/index.php">Computer and Information Sciences</a> and <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/urban/">Urban Studies</a> from University of Pennsylvania. 

Feel free to reach me at <a href="linkedin.com/soyoungprk">LinkedIn</a> if you want to chat.
