<p style="padding-top:30px;">
I am a software engineer at Twitter, based in San Francisco Bay Area. I like to use programming to solve what I believe are important and meaningful problems. I have a B.A. in <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/index.php">Computer and Information Sciences</a> and <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/urban/">Urban Studies</a> from University of Pennsylvania. 

Feel free to reach me at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/soyoungprk">LinkedIn</a> if you want to chat.
